This is an attempt at making a better Sonos controller for iOS. It's pretty hacked together right now -- I'll try to articulate needs later so others can contribute. The following (sparse) instructions below should get it working with your system.

## First figure out the IP addresses of all your speakers.

Easiest way to do this is to checkout: [https://github.com/rahims/SoCo](https://github.com/rahims/SoCo) and use the command line example. Run: `python sonoshell.py all list_ips` to find all the IPs. Then run `python sonoshell.py YOUR_SPEAKERS_IP_ADDRESS info` to determine the uid for each speaker.

Now open the file PLNowPlayingViewController.m and replace lines 79-82 with your speaker information. Compile and you should be able to control the volume of your speakers.
